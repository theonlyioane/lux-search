You further agree that this information may be distributed by the company to third parties without your knowledge for the purposes of finding employment, reference verification or any other purpose deemed appropriate by the company. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the company from any damages caused through any misrepresentation made.</p>

You acknowledge that you do not acquire any rights to reuse the content, layout and data in any manner. Use of the website and its data is governed by these terms and conditions. The data presented by the company is protected under international copyright laws.</p>

It is strongly recommended that any employer verify the credentials and job history of any applicant prior to hiring.</p>

                                    <p>Many yacht crew work as a team with their partner. The company reserves the right to charge a second placement fee for the partner when the crew coordinator makes the employer aware of the team status during the initial introduction.</p>

                                    <h4 class="m-t-40 ">11. Hiring authority</h4>

                                    <p>The company assumes no authority to hire crew on your behalf. Our recommendation does not constitute a warranty that the crew member is a perfect match for your program and the liability for the costs associated with interviewing, hiring and whenever necessary, repatriating crew members rests solely with the employer. Luxury Yacht Group highly recommends that all employers conduct detailed interviews and verifies all licensing and reference information before extending an offer of employment to any candidate.</p>

No modification to these terms and conditions shall be made unless specifically agreed to in writing. The company reserves the right to change these terms and conditions from time to time and will post the changes on the website and make them available for clients to review upon request.</p>
